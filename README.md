**The development of the algorithm as well as the research documentation have been done in the context of an assignment provided by my university on my second year (2024). However, as I have been enjoying the process of model optimisation for time complexity, I found myself going beyond the scope of the academic requirements. The paper explaining the code has been provided in this repository.**

In order to maximise my learning experience, I have not been using any AI whether in the code part or the explanations.
